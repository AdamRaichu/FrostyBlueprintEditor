    /// ClientAndServer - 2 copies of this connection will run side by side, one on the server's machine, one on the clients. This does NOT mean they are synced across both client and server.

    /// Server - This is ran exclusively on the servers machine, and this exact networkable is synced identically for all clients.
    /// NetworkedClient - This is ran on the clients machine, and is synced across other clients through the server.
    /// NetworkedClientAndServer - Same as ClientAndServer, except with NetworkedClient.
